![Life update](/images/blog/sad.jfif)

It’s been a while since I wrote anything personal. Or maybe wrote anything at all.

Most people who know me now know me through tech — blockchain threads, AI builds, frontend experiments, Nuwell updates. But not everyone knows that I started as a writer.

Writing was the first thing I did seriously.  
**Before blockchain.**  
**Before AI.**  
**Before building Nuwell.**  

Somewhere along the way, I transitioned into blockchain and AI while still juggling frontend development, school, and building things. It wasn’t a clean transition. It was messy. Late nights. Switching contexts. Writing work codes and trying everything to make sure I don't breakdown.

### The Shift

A few weeks ago, I lost one of jobs I do.  
The company was transitioning into something different, and my department was dissolved. It was exciting. It felt aligned But do I really see a sustained future in it? maybe I am just negative.

**Yesterday, I lost a second one.**

Not because I failed.  
Not because I wasn’t good enough.  
*Just another restructuring.*

Still, it stings, Two 'stable jobs' in a month feels like what village people alone can do, but we all know how the technology revolution is affecting companies now.  
I have one more semester left in school. And I don’t even know whether this moment is a setback or a strange opportunity disguised as one.

> "It’s quiet now."

No daily pressure.  
No task notifications.  

Just me, school, Rust, ideas, and a *slightly uncomfortable amount of free space*.

If I’m being honest, there’s sadness. There’s uncertainty. There’s that voice that whispers, *“What now?”*

### But there’s also something else.

**Relief.**

Relief that I can pause and decide intentionally what the next phase looks like. Relief that I’m not forced into something that doesn’t align. Relief that maybe this is the reset before a sharper direction.

If you have work that needs:
- **Script automation**  
- **Account automation systems**  
- **AI app development**  
- **Clean frontend builds**  
- **Blockchain-integrated systems**  

I’m open. And I’m building.

This is the first article on my portfolio in a long time. Expect more — about tech, life, Rust, AI, systems thinking, and whatever I’m wrestling with in the moment.

And if you have anything to ask or say, please drop it in my dm. hehe.

Also, take a look at [Nuwell](https://nuwellai.com). We recently crossed a milestone with a few paying subscribers—including one all the way from France 🇫🇷. It might seem small, but that bit of global validation has been the singlular reason I haven't given up on it yet.
I started as a writer.  
*Maybe I never stopped.*
